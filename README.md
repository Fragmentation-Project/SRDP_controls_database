# SRDP common control variables database

This repo contains the sourcing and munging scripts for common control variables included in the Strategies of Resistance Data Project. This includes both country- and group-level data.

It provides a full trail from the source data to the final data points used in analysis. 

It will be converted into a package shortly to provide R users with easy access to the data. A .csv will also be provided for more general access and use.
